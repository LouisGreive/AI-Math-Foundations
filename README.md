# 🧮 AI Math Foundations

**Status:** 🟢 Active Learning
**Focus:** Linear Algebra, Statistics, Calculus for Machine Learning
**Tools:** Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

## 🎯 Purpose
This repository documents my systematic journey to master the mathematical foundations required for Artificial Intelligence engineering. As an Applied AI student and Systems Thinker, I believe in building a "First Principles" understanding of the algorithms I use.

## 📚 Learning Log

| Date | Topic | Key Concepts | Code |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Nov 2025 | **Vectors** | Definition, Magnitude, Direction, Dot Product | [`vectors_basics.py`](./vectors_basics.py) |
| *Upcoming* | **Matrices** | Matrix Multiplication, Transposition, Inverse | ... |
| *Upcoming* | **Statistics**| Mean, Variance, Standard Deviation | ... |

## 🧠 Why This Matters
"You cannot build a skyscraper if you don't understand the physics of the materials."
Similarly, I cannot build robust AI systems if I don't understand the Linear Algebra that powers them.
